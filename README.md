Thank you for providing that information. I'll update the README to show how to properly use your Composer package. Here's an updated version of the README that includes installation via Composer and usage instructions:

# PinkyFlow

PinkyFlow is a modular PHP framework designed to provide a flexible and easy-to-use base for creating web applications. It offers a variety of modules, including user authentication, shopping cart management, comment systems, and more.

## Installation

You can install PinkyFlow using Composer. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
composer require jadempinky/pinkyflow
```

## Usage

After installing PinkyFlow via Composer, you can use it in your project as follows:

1. Include the Composer autoloader in your PHP file:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

2. Initialize the PinkyFlow framework:

```php
use PinkyFlow\PinkyFlow;

$pinkyFlow = new PinkyFlow();
```

3. Now you can use the various modules and features of PinkyFlow:

```php
// Example: User registration
$user = $pinkyFlow->getUser();
try {
    $username = 'newuser';
    $password = 'securepassword123';
    $user->register($username, $password);
    echo 'User registered successfully!';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
}

// Example: Adding a product
$shop = $pinkyFlow->getShop();
$productData = [
    'name' => 'Example Product',
    'description' => 'This is an example product.',
    'price' => 19.99,
];
$shop->addProduct($productData);
echo 'Product added successfully!';

// Example: Adding a comment
$comment = $pinkyFlow->getComment();
if ($user->isLoggedIn()) {
    $productId = 'product123';
    $commentText = 'Great product!';
    $rating = 5;
    try {
        $comment->addComment($productId, $commentText, null, $rating);
        echo 'Comment added successfully!';
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
    }
}
```

## Configuration

PinkyFlow can be configured by creating a `config.php` file in your project root. Refer to the PinkyFlow documentation for available configuration options.
