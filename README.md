## Usage Instructions

### Installation
1. Clone or download the PinkyFlow PHP library.
2. Initialize the database connection by setting up the `PinkyFlowDB` class in your application.
3. Include the necessary modules:
   - `PinkyFlowUser` for user management
   - `PinkyFlowProduct` for product catalog and shopping
   - `PinkyFlowCart` for cart functionalities

### Example: Enabling Modules

// Enable specific modules
$enableDatabase = true;
$enableUserModule = true;
$enableShoppingModule = true;
$enableCommentModule = false;

// Initialize the DB connection
$db = new PinkyFlowDB('host', 'user', 'password', 'database_name');

## Known Issues & Things to Watch Out For
- **Database Connection Errors:** If the database setup is incorrect or unavailable, it will result in a failed connection. Ensure correct database credentials.
- **Session Management:** Make sure sessions are initialized properly. Otherwise, login and cart features might malfunction.
- **Product Stock Issues:** Ensure the product stock count is accurate, as the checkout process does not handle negative stock situations automatically yet.
- **Duplicate Entries:** Be cautious when adding favorites or wishlist items, as adding duplicates can raise exceptions.
